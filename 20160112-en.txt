Day 1

I past all my life thinking than I can live without the English language. 
I was wrong, really wrong. 
English isn't a strategy from USA to conquer the world
English language is just a tool for communicate with others around the world. 
English is easy to learn (and prononce) so, why can't I just let my brain start this journey?
